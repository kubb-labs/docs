# Use Kubb with Context7

Kubb's documentation is indexed on [Context7](https://context7.com) under the library ID `/kubb-labs/docs`.

::steps{level="2"}

## Set up Context7

Run the interactive setup and select your AI assistant:

```shell [Terminal]
npx ctx7 setup
```

The setup connects Context7 through MCP or installs its documentation skill, depending on the
option you select.

## Use Kubb documentation

Include `use context7` in your prompt. Add the Kubb library ID when you want to skip library
discovery:

```text [Prompt]
Create a kubb.config.ts that generates TypeScript types, a Fetch client, and React Query hooks
from ./petStore.yaml. Use Context7 library /kubb-labs/docs.
```

A rule in your assistant's instructions can make it use Context7 for every Kubb question.
