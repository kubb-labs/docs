# Publish snapshots with GitLab CI

Publish an installable Kubb Studio snapshot from GitLab CI so reviewers can compare generated files against the target branch and previous pipelines. Store `KUBB_TOKEN` as a masked CI/CD variable, commit your npm lockfile, and keep `kubb` in the development dependencies so `npm ci` installs the CLI.
