# Options

`pluginBarrel` takes no arguments. You configure it through `output.barrel`, either on `defineConfig` to set the root barrel and the default every plugin inherits, or on a single plugin to override that plugin's barrel. The plugin-level behavior is also summarized under [`output.barrel`](/docs/5.x/reference/plugin-options#output-barrel) in the shared plugin options.

## Options overview

| Option | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`output.barrel`](#output-barrel) | Re-export style for the barrel files. | `false` on `defineConfig`, `{ type: 'named' }` in every generator plugin's default `output` |
| ↳ [`output.barrel.type`](#type) | Named exports or a wildcard export. | Required when `output.barrel` is an object |
| ↳ [`output.barrel.nested`](#nested) | Choose whether barrels reference subdirectory barrels. | `false` |

## Option details

### output.barrel

Toggle the export style and depth to see the generated barrels.

::barrel-tree
::

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `{ type: 'all' \| 'named', nested?: boolean } \| false` |
| Required | `false` |
| Default | `false` |

The `type` field picks the export style. A plugin's `output.barrel` also accepts `nested`, so the plugin writes an `index.ts` in every subdirectory. The root `output.barrel` has no `nested` field and always stays flat.

Call a plugin with no `output` at all and it uses its own default, which already sets `barrel: { type: 'named' }`. The moment you pass an `output` object of your own, that default is replaced whole, so a plugin configured as `pluginTs({ output: { path: 'types' } })` has no `barrel` of its own and falls back to `config.output.barrel`, which is `false` unless you set it.

Set `barrel: { type: 'named' | 'all' }` on `defineConfig` to enable barrels everywhere: a root barrel, and the default every plugin without its own `output.barrel` inherits. A plugin that sets its own `output.barrel` overrides that inherited value, including back to `false`, which also drops its files from the root barrel. A plugin with `output.mode: 'file'` gets no barrel of its own, and the root barrel re-exports that file directly.

### type

Export style for the barrel files. Required whenever `output.barrel` is set to an object.

::field-group

:::field{name="'named'"}
Re-exports each symbol by name from the file's named exports. Best for tree-shaking and explicit imports.
:::

:::field{name="'all'"}
Uses `export *`, a smaller barrel that re-exports everything.
:::

::

::code-group

```typescript ['named']
// src/gen/index.ts
export { getUser, User } from './api/user'
export { getPost, Post } from './api/post'
export { User } from './api/types/User'
```

```typescript ['all']
// src/gen/index.ts
export * from './api/user'
export * from './api/post'
export * from './api/types/User'
```

::

### nested

Changes what each barrel references. A barrel is written for every directory either way. With `nested: false`, the plugin's top barrel reaches through to the leaf files. With `nested: true`, each barrel re-exports only what sits directly inside its directory, including the subdirectory barrels below it, so callers can import from any depth. This field works on a plugin's `output.barrel` only.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `boolean` |
| Required | `false` |
| Default | `false` |

::code-group

```typescript [nested: false (default) → barrels reference leaf files]
// src/gen/api/index.ts
export * from './user'
export * from './post'
export * from './types/User'

// src/gen/api/types/index.ts
export * from './User'
```

```typescript [nested: true → barrels reference sub-barrels]
// src/gen/api/index.ts re-exports its files and subdirectories
export * from './user'
export * from './post'
export * from './types'

// src/gen/api/types/index.ts re-exports its files
export * from './User'
```
